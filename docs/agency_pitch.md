# Dental Bot — Agency Pitch & Sales Strategy

This document provides a concise pitch, pricing tiers, and a repeatable sales playbook for agencies reselling the Dental Bot widget to dental clinics.

## Elevator pitch
- Convert more website visitors into booked appointments with a lightweight embeddable chat widget tailored for dental clinics. It answers FAQs, surfaces availability, and captures warm leads directly into your CRM.

## Key benefits
- Increases bookings and lead capture without adding staff.
- HIPAA-aware deployment options (avoid PHI by default; collect minimal contact info).
- Fast integration: single script tag or static bundle.
- Analytics and conversion tracking built-in.

## Pricing Tiers (suggested)
- Starter: $49/mo — widget, basic analytics, up to 1 clinic.
- Pro: $199/mo — multi-clinic, email lead forwarding, priority support.
- Enterprise: Custom — SLA, dedicated Redis, SSO, integrations (PMS/EMR).

## Sales playbook
1. Identify target clinics (high-traffic sites with booking friction).
2. Offer a free 30-day pilot with basic setup and onboarding.
3. During pilot, track conversion uplift (bookings/leads) and create a concise ROI report.
4. Close with a standard monthly plan; offer annual discount.

## Onboarding checklist for clinics
- Verify domain and CORS settings for API.
- Provide clinic contact email for lead routing.
- Configure booking_url in clinic record.
- Install script tag or use CMS snippet injection.

## Objection handling
- Data/Privacy: explain we minimize PII, use secure persistence, and offer on-premises or VPC-hosted deployments.
- Cost: present conversion uplift examples and quick ROI calc (e.g., 10 extra bookings/month pays for the widget).

## Materials to include in sales kit
- One-page product brief (PDF)
- Demo site (hosted) and screencast
- Case study template and pilot report
